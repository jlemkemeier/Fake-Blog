Really had a great time last night performing at the Royal Intellectual Society in London. Thanks to everyone who came out to see the show. The crowd was truly electric. A special thanks to the Duke of Wellington and the Prince of Whales for inciting a riot in the mosh pit, it really livened up the performance. I canâ€™t wait to see all of you at my next show, at the Royal Geographical Society in a month.
